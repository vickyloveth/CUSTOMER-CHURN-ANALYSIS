# Customer Churn Analysis (Excel Project)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecommunications company using Excel to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights.

The goal is to understand:
- How many customers churned
- How pricing affects customers
- Whether churn differs by gender

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Data Overview and Simple Sorting
In this task, I explored the dataset to understand its structure and key variables. I sorted customers by tenure to identify those with the shortest and longest durations and filtered the data to focus on customers who have churned. This helped establish a foundation for further analysis and visualization.

### Task 2: Churn Count Visualization
- Created column chart for churned vs non-churned customers
- Added labels and formatted chart for clarity

I visualized the number of:

Customers who churned

Customers who remained active


Using a column chart, I clearly compared both groups and displayed exact counts with data labels.

📌 Insight: A quick glance revealed that non-churned customers significantly outnumber churned customers — a good sign, but still room for improvement


### Task 3: Monthly Charges Distribution
- Created histogram with bin size of 10
- Analyzed pricing concentration and patterns

I analyzed how customers are distributed across different price ranges using a histogram with 10-unit intervals.

📌 Insight: Most customers fall within low to mid-range monthly plans, while fewer customers use higher-priced subscriptions — an important finding for pricing strategy and customer segmentation.

### Task 4: Churn Rate by Gender
- Built Pivot Table for churn counts by gender
- Used clustered bar chart to compare churn behavior

Using a Pivot Table and clustered bar chart, I compared churn behavior across gender.

📌 Insight: This helped uncover whether churn patterns differ between males and females and how retention strategies could be better tailored.
